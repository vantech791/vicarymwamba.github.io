								<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
								<p>My name is vicary Mwamba and i am a web developer, i have been learning and practicing web development for close to a year, i started off my journey in early january of 2020. I started off first with familiarizing myself with the python programming langauage, i learned python for a month before working on a real project which was a carrency calculator, changing dollar to kwacha and vice versa, after two months of programming in python, i picked my html and css that i had been doing prior to learning python. and a month down the line and i was creating web applications with html and css on the backened, and python(flask) on the backened. After that i picked up JavaScriptand and bootstrap, and till this day strengthening my skills in js ever since that time i have been creating simple websites to improve my skills, and recently started offering lessons about web development.</p>

								<p> Am i the best web developer in the world absolutly not but i'm aspiring and passionate that i will craete some fun and beautiful websites for my buddies (you).</p>

								<h4>MY HOBBIES</h4>
								<p>Aside from ptogramming i'm exetremly into reading, fantasy novels preferably, i also love learning langauages and being able to communicate with people of a different tongue in the native langauages. At the moment my only fluent langauage is english but i've also been learning japanese, spanish and russian over the past months.</p>

								<p>I am also a drummer, been playing drums for a year and i think i just stepped out of the beginner phase and into the intermidiate. And i also exetremly love musice, indie music and alternative are my favourites, beach house is my current favourite band. I am a simple person and open to learning something everday, i thought this would be a good way for you to get to know me more aside that i'm your web developer. <br>THANK SO MUCH FOR READING.</p>
